## Update from Levi

Hey guys, so this is the code that I have thrown together for the server. It is not ready to integrate with the client
so when we create a client script we'll need to throw both functionality in together, but we shouldn't worry about that 
right now. I think all of the functionality is in place. There might be a slight logic error when the progam is force exited,
but I haven't looked into that all too much. I think everything else should be good to go!  

## Dependencies 

This program requires libcurl in order to make HTTPS requests. Make sure the `libcurl` and `libcurl-devel` libraries are installed.
