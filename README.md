# Team Leopard - iCU

## Update from Levi

Hey guys, so this is the code that I have thrown together for the server. It is not ready to integrate with the client
so when we create a client script we'll need to throw both functionality in together, but we shouldn't worry about that 
right now. Everything works from the server side except the 15 minute timer for when you are found - it should only take 5
or so more minutes. I guess that means at the time of me writing this its technically broken since the timer is only 
half-implemented. I'll be in class on Thursday (tomorrow) and we can get working on the rest of this thing!
